Verse, and UEFN and Fortnite and UE5 with a convergence of the tech upcoming in UE6
This started as a collection of all the information and links about Epic's Verse programming language, but since Verse is expected to converge into the general Unreal codebase in 2024 or 2025 the scope of information found here will expand to be more useful to everyone Unreal with the addition of information on Fortnite as well as the traditional Unreal UE5 ecosystem

# Verse (UEFN, UE6)

"Verse is being designed as a programming language for the metaverse, with upcoming features to enable future scalability to *vast open worlds built by millions of creators for billions of players*. Verse is launching in Fortnite today, and will come to all Unreal Engine users a couple years down the road."
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/dive-into-epic-s-announcements-from-gdc-2023

Verse has been designed by Simon Peyton Jones and Tim Sweeney but very few people should start their Verse learning journey by examining the design.

- Unreal Engine .NET 6 integration - UnrealCLR is a plugin which natively integrates .NET host into the Unreal Engine with the Common Language Runtime for direct execution of managed code to build a game/application logic using the full power of C# 10.0, F# 6.0, and .NET facilities with engine API. The project is aimed at stability, performance, and maintainability. https://github.com/nxrighthere/UnrealCLR
- ![dotnet](https://github.com/VerseMetaVerse/UnrealVerse/assets/17344588/ba02d53e-b257-4d03-927c-5fb4745b2737) UnrealSharp attempts to add a dotnet core integration to some parts of Unreal Engine. It does this by creating what the dotnet documentation calls a "native host" in the context of a subsystem, and exposes functionality by providing function pointers to dotnet https://github.com/lambda-snail/UnrealSharp


# UNREAL STUDIO

## UE6

Since Verse is expected to converge into the general Unreal codebase in 2024 or 2025 the scope of information found here will probably expand to be more useful to everyone

## UE5

Since Verse is expected to converge into the general Unreal codebase in 2024 or 2025 the scope of information found here will probably expand to be more useful to everyone

## UEFN

Unfortunately, the only way to compile and run Verse programs is within the UEFN editing environment. (See below for a list of experimental Verses) Verse will eventually beccome standard in all versions of Unreal in order to provide increased security and massive scale, which is essential to supporting a MetaVerse.

Verse is supposed to be released as OSS at which point we might see a stand alone compiler which would really reduce one barrier to learning the language. You could then also envision from that a Jupyter compatible version that would encourage adhoc and online learning.

Delivering the first version of of Verse as Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) means that there are 3 sub systems of concern in making a Verse program:

- The Verse Language itself - https://github.com/kbfngg/uefn/blob/main/modules/Verse/Verse.digest.verse
- An interface API to Unreal - https://github.com/kbfngg/uefn/blob/main/modules/UnrealEngine/UnrealEngine.digest.verse
- An interface API to Fornite - https://github.com/kbfngg/uefn/blob/main/modules/Fortnite/Fortnite.digest.verse

Every Verse project generates 3 digest files that correspond to that

## Misc Verse code on Github

- STARS - if you have wandered to this repo wondering why I gave your project a STAR, well first a reward for uploading any Verse Code which is not common at all and second it makes easier for me to identify new projects with Verse...

This list is NOT curated but it might be useful to you since it is surprisingly hard to search for Verse code repos on Github due to name congestion (any topic with a -verse e.g. SpiderVerse) and the lack of a GitHub language type for Verse
